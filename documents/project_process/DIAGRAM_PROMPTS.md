# Diagram Generation Prompts

These prompts are designed for AI Image Generators (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E 3) or Diagramming Tools (Mermaid, PlantUML) to visualize the Universal Security Brain.

## 1. System Architecture (High Level)

**Prompt**:
> Create a clean, modern software architecture diagram. Central node: "Orchestrator Brain" (glowing blue). Connected to satellites: "Scanner" (Green), "Analysis AI" (Purple), "Remediation AI" (Orange), "Sandbox" (Red). Infrastructure layer below: "PostgreSQL Database" and "Redis Queue". Style: Tech, Minimalist, White Background, Isometric 3D.

## 2. The Pipeline Flow

**Prompt**:
> A linear flowchart visualization of a security pipeline. Steps: (1) Developer Commits Code -> (2) CI/CD Scanner -> (3) Orchestrator Ingest -> (4) AI Analysis (Magnifying Glass icon) -> (5) Auto-Fix (Wrench icon) -> (6) Pull Request (Git Branch icon). Use arrows to show flow. Color palette: Cyan and Dark Grey.

## 3. Dashboard UI Concept

**Prompt**:
> A futuristic UI design for a cybersecurity dashboard. Dark mode. Central map showing "Threats". Sidebars with "Active Scans" and "Vulnerability List". Color scheme: Deep Navy background with Neon Green status indicators. High fidelity, 4k resolution.

## 4. Agent Interaction Pattern

**Prompt**:
> A network diagram showing three AI agents collaborating. Agent 1 "Triage" passes a document to Agent 2 "Remediation". Agent 3 "Red Team" is attacking a shield. All connected to a central "Master Brain". Style: Abstract, node-based, data streams connecting them.
